BUGS:
excatly landing on the corner of a block doesn't give you your jump back (even though there's not getting stuck bug anymore)



i think the problem came when i switched from "hspeed" to "x +=", maybe "hspeed" syncs up with the cpu rate somehow
whereas "x +=" is limited by the fps rate



landing on exact corner of block sometimes causes a bug when you're invincible (happened once when not invincible)

music is becoming unsynced as the game progresses due to fps drops
	fix?: lower the fps of the game down to 40

maybe i could just have all the alarms go off of the global.beat so that it's all synced to one thing an i only 
have to match that one thing to the music

rain stops sooner than it should
game still gets off sync

Feature Ideas:

-if i made the song 75 bars long, that's 300 measures. I could give each song a dedicated amount of space for
the background of the bonus song game, and whatever blocky art i use there could be used in the lyric book pdf as 
the background for each page/song

this would be 128 x 400 pixels for each song
if i cut that in half to be 128 x 200, the ratio is .64, and the ratio for normal paper is .66
so i could use it in the book








-maybe they could enter a cheat code and it makes them flying and invincible for the entire game


maybe have the special end room have fireworks




-hidden/secret blocks that look just like regular ones, but if you smash them with your head, they do cool stuff
(maybe like a little firework or something, or it changes your character color)



MISC:
remember to label all the code once i'm done so that i can come back and tell what's going on

-------------------------------------------
Unsorted


I could take the time on the computer when the music starts, and then periodically compare that to the current time on the computer to determine where the timers should be.



i could make a cool character, and make a tshirt of the character, with the ekg looking line behind him, on a blank tshirt



if you make it all the way to the end, your character just stands there and the song loops.



song is 150 beats per minute = 2.5 beats per minute


the fast part is 4 notes per beat,
so that's 10 times per second


when you get to the end, it's sort of like a 'you win' screen where your character just sits there and you can listen to
the track indefinitely

maybe make it so that when you die, the song fades our really fast instead of just cutting off



This game was inspired by "The Impossible Game"
