150 bpm = 2.5 beats per second

there is a beat every 4/10 of a second


80 steps (game run speed) times 4/10 = 32 pixels (width of blocks)

if player moves 4 pixels per step,

it takes 8 steps to cross a block (1/10th of a second)


each block is equal to a 16th note (4 blocks per beat- beat = quarter note)

32 pixels per block, 4 blocks per beat, 4 beats per measue = 512 pixels per measure






-during the rain part, maybe i could double the player speed
